# **FTL Spacecrew Universal Cockpit Kontroller System**

A custom plugin written in C/C++ for a KSP controller. Written for the FTL Cockpit. 

## **Instructions**

### Kerbal Simpit and CKAN

To install the KSP mod, you have to:

* Install it through CKAN by installing Simpit (version 2.0.0 or after).

Don't forget to update your port name in the KerbalSimpit\Settings.cfg file ! Copy it from Settings.cfg.sample if it does not already exists. You can find the right port name by copying the port name you are using in the Arduino IDE.

To install the Arduino lib, you can go to the KerbalSimpit folder installed previously and 
copy the KerbalSimpitRevamped-Arduino into your Arduino library folder (usually under Documents\Arduino\libraries). 
Then you can open your Arduino IDE and you should find some Simpit examples in the example list. It should be included in the Arduino library manager shortly.
